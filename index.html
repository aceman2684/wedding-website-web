      <h1 class="section__title">Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Our love story began back in high school when we were brought together
        by our mutual friend, Taylor Hart (Matron of Honor). The three of us
        were good friends for over a year until our senior year when Conor
        finally asked Amber on a date to the movies (which Amber thought was a
        friendly gesture- but Conor thought otherwise). He dropped her off after
        the movie only to run up after her to the doorstep to give her the most
        unexpected and passionate kiss. She was taken back, to say the least. In
        fact, she was so unsure of what had happened that she avoided him for an
        entire week (the longest week of Conor's life). She finally came to her
        senses and realized that she had an opportunity with a truly amazing,
        genuine, and caring man- so she took it, and the rest was history!
      </p>
      <p>
        Six years later Conor and Amber have truly experienced life together.
        They have laughed together, cried together, supported one another, taken
        part in a long-distance relationship, and have been there for each other
        at both their highest and lowest moments. They have traveled together,
        experienced college life side-by-side, got their first apartment, and
        adopted their precious fur-baby, Moose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, Conor popped the question after a night in. He realized that
        the love they shared was not about the fancy things, the good food, or
        the extravagant events, but the small moments in-between. Kneeling on
        the side of his bed, Conor asked Amber to marry him. This time she knew
        her answer instantly, it was a definite yes!
